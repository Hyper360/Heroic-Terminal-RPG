Good day sir. What would you like?
Becareful on your travels young sir.
Stay sober sire.
Are you here to enjoy a drink with the other gentlemen?
Parhaps a toast?
Rumor has it there's a dragon lurking in the nearby mountains.
Care for a drink before your daring quest?
Any interest in tomb raiding today?
Remember, in this world of swords and sorcery, it's wise to keep one eye on your drink and the other on the shadows
